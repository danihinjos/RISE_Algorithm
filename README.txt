The contents of this .zip file are the following:

- A folder called "Documentation" with the report of the assignment in .pdf format.
- A folder called "Data" with the datasets used in .arff format. Note that these datasets will be split into train and
test once the project has been run.
- A folder called "Source" with the source code of the implementation:
    - "main.py": this is the principal file that will need to be executed.
    - "RISE.py": this is the file containing the RISE class with all the main methods of the algorithm.
    - "utils.py": this is an auxiliar file with auxiliar methods used for different functionalities (mainly dataset
    loading, dataset preprocessing and rule interpreter).
- An extra folder called "Results" with the rule set generated for the best execution of each dataset. Additionally, a file called "rice_output.txt" is appended so that the output of the whole process, where the different stages of the algorithm are differentiated, is appreciated.
- Another .zip containing the PyCharm project, to facilitate its execution.

Note that the PyCharm project is composed by three .py files and two folders: "datasets" and "results". In order for it to work properly, the dataset files should be located inside "datasets" folder. Therefore, if you want to execute the .py files located in the "Source" folder by themselves, remember to include at least a folder called "datasets" in the root directory and locate the dataset files there.
